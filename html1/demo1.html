        <br> Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (transl. Commander) is a 2023 Indian Telugu-language epic action film written and directed by Prashanth Neel and <br> produced by Vijay Kiragandur. It stars Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran, with a supporting cast that includes Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu,<br> Bobby Simha, Tinnu Anand, Easwari Rao, Sriya Reddy and Ramachandra Raju. Set in the fictional dystopian city-state of Khansaar, the film <br> follows the friendship between Deva (Prabhas), a tribesman, and Varadha (Prithviraj), the prince of Khansaar. When a coup d'état is planned  <br> by his father's ministers and his relatives, Varadha enlists Deva's help to become Khansaar's undisputed ruler.

        <br> The film's initial story was pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014)[4] and is the maiden part of a two-part film. It was officially <br> announced in December 2020 under the title Salaar, however, in July 2023, the official title was announced as Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. <br> Principal photography commenced in January 2021, and occurred sporadically in several legs over nearly three years, before wrapping in late <br> 2023.Filming locations included Telangana, Italy and Budapest. Production difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots and VFX delays,<br> postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music is composed by Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and editing by <br> Ujwal Kulkarni.

        <br> Salaar was theatrically released on 22 December 2023 in standard and IMAX formats to a generally mixed-to-positive reception from critics. <br> It was a hit at the box office, earning over ₹715 crore on a ₹270 crore budget, making it the highest-grossing Telugu film of 2023, 3rd <br> highest-grossing Telugu film of all time and 11th highest-grossing Indian film of all time.[5][6]

        <h2>PLOT</h2><hr>
        In the year 1985, Deva and Vardharaja "Vardha" Mannar are inseparable companions in Khansaar, a puissant city-state ruled by <br> Vardha's father, Raja Mannar. After Raja Mannar, the chief of the Mannar tribe, commands the decimation of the Shouryaanga <br> tribe, a mob pounces on Deva and his mother at their residence, but Vardha intercedes for them and confers an important <br>territory of his in exchange for sparing their lives. Before exiting Khansaar, Deva vows to return on Vardha's call.

        In 2017, a business tycoon, Krishnakanth, learns that his daughter, Aadhya, arrived at Varanasi from New York to finish her <br>mother's last rites. This alerts Krishnakanth's old rivals, who conspire to abduct her, but Krishnakanth enlists the <br>assistance of Bilal, who thwarts the enemies' attempts to seize her and safeguards her at his friend, Deva's place, in <br>Tinsukia, Assam. Aadhya pretends to be an English teacher at a school where Deva's mother is the headmaster. Eventually,<br> Aadhya is traced to Tinsukia where upon his mother's reluctant orders, Deva hinders the goons' attempts to capture her. <br>Dreading for Deva, Deva's mother plans to abscond with him, while Aadhya and Bilal are carried off in a convoy led by Rinda <br>and one that is sealed with the mysterious emblem of Khansaar.

        Witnessing this, Deva's mother signals him to rescue Aadhya and Bilal. He immediately refrains the convoy,<br> grabbing the attention of Vardha and his step-sister, Radha Rama Mannar, who has ordered Aadhya's<br> abduction to avenge something Krishnakanth has committed against her in Deva's favour, seven years ago. Radha admits to strategizing the events to<br> pit Deva and Vardha against each other since opposing the seal of Khansaar is a crime and the perpetrator has to be killed, a rule that Deva himself<br>is told to have established seven years ago. After their rescue, Bilal recounts the tale of Khansaar and Deva and Vardha's past to Aadhya.

        In 1127, notorious dacoits from the three tribes of Mannars, Shouryaangas, and Ghaniyaars consolidated their influence over an area called Khansaar.In<br> the year 1947 after the Indian independence, Raja Mannar's father, Siva Mannar, the chieftain of the Mannar tribe, refused Khansaar to be a part of<br> the country and governed by the Constitution of India. He signed a pact with the Indian government that retained Khansaar's autonomy and erased its<br> existence from the map. He segregated Khansaar into 101 provinces and appointed Kapus (governors) to head them. In the hierarchy, above the Kapus<br> were Doras (feudal lords), who were submissive to the Karta (King).

        After Siva Mannar's demise in 1985, Dhaara, the chieftain of the Shouryaanga tribe, was selected to be the next King, but Raja Mannar usurped the <br> throne by assassinating Dhaara and massacred the entire Shouryaanga tribe. Subsequently, Raja Mannar recruited his close confidants and family as<br> Doras to rule the city-state. In 2010, Raja Mannar's son-in-law, Bhaarava, pleaded with him to consider reconciling with Vardha, who was banished in<br> 1985 for giving away his territory to a Ghaniyaar tribesman. Raja Mannar commanded Ranga (whose father Vardha bribed his territory to in 1985), one of<br> the Doras, to sacrifice his position for Vardha's sake and thus, Ranga was instilled with rage and jealousy towards Vardha, while Raja Mannar's children<br> from his first wife, Rudra Raja Mannar and Radha Rama Mannar, were against this decision.

        Raja Mannar temporarily delegated his responsibilities to Radha Rama and left Khansaar to look over a concerning issue. In order to prevent violence in <br> his absence, Radha Rama proposed imposing a ceasefire, but her decision was opposed to a large extent and a voting on whether to lift the ceasefire or<br> impose it was supposed to take place after nine days. Immediately, all the Doras and Kapus brought powerful mercenary armies from Serbia, Austria,<br> Ukraine, Afghanistan, Russia and South Sudan with the intent of usurping the throne as soon as the voting ended. Meanwhile, Vardha turned to Deva,<br> who resided in Bharuch, Gujarat with his mother. Deva re-entered Khansaar and for most of the days, tolerated the humiliation of Vardha by the Doras<br> and their henchmen.

        However, Deva eventually fought and murdered Vishnu, son of Narang, one of the Doras, as he tried to rape a girl; instigated by Bhaarava, Rudra pit <br> Narang against Vardha and directed him to punish him during the trial, instead of Deva. During the trial, an infuriated Deva slaughtered and beheaded <br> Narang for manhandling Vardha, after pleading with him not to do so, stunning all the witnesses. Vardha, Deva, and all of their associates including <br> Vardha's younger brother, Baachi, aides Bilal and Rinda, and advisor, Gaikwad alias Baba, were all apprehended. On the day of the voting, Raja Mannar <br> suddenly returned to Khansaar and voted to continue the ceasefire, in favor of Vardha. However, Vardha, with his deciding vote, voted to terminate the <br> imposition of the ceasefire.

        Immediately, everyone staked their claim for the throne; Vardha, after defeating drug-addicted men dispatched by Ranga with Deva's assistance, broke <br> out of prison and killed Ranga. Raja Mannar disclosed to Radha Rama that Bhaarava actually hailed from the Shouryaanga tribe and is one of the few <br> people that survived the massacre of the tribe in 1985. Elsewhere, Bhaarava and an army of the surviving Shouryaanga tribesmen swore vengeance <br> against Raja Mannar for the genocide of their tribe. Rudra joined hands with his maternal uncle, Om, for the throne. Bhaarava's captured associate, <br> Dheru, revealed to Raja Mannar and Radha Rama that Deva is actually Devaratha Raisaar, the son of Dhaara Raisaar, who was the chief of the <br> Shouryaanga tribe and supposed to be the next king of Khansaar in 1985. Simultaneously, Vardha addressed Deva as his Salaar, just as his loyalists <br> learnt that he is a Shouryaanga tribesman.
